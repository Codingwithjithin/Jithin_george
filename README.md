👋 About Me

Exploring the ever-evolving world of technology with a strong focus on AI & Machine Learning. I enjoy building intelligent systems while continuously strengthening my foundation in software development and problem-solving.

🤖 Working as an AI/ML Engineer, building and experimenting with data-driven models. 

🐍 Proficient in Python, with hands-on experience in ML workflows and backend logic.

🧠 Actively practicing Data Structures & Algorithms to sharpen analytical thinking.

⚔️ Passionate about competitive programming and logical challenges.

💡 Curious about scalable software systems and clean, efficient code. 

Driven by curiosity, consistency, and the thrill of cracking tough problems — especially when a solution finally clicks after hours of debugging 😄
